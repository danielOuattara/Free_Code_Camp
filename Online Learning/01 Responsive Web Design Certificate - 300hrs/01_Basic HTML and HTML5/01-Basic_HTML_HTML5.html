<!--Introduction to Basic HTML & HTML5

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language used to describe the structure of a web page. 
It uses a special syntax or notation to organize and give information about the page to the browser.
 Elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. 
 For example, there are different tag options to place around text to show whether it is a heading, a paragraph, or a list.

For example:

<h1>Top level heading: Maybe a page title</h1>

<p>A paragraph of text. Some information we would like to communicate to the viewer. This can be as long or short as we would like.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Number one on the list</li>
  <li>Number two</li>
  <li>A third item</li>
</ol>

Becomes:
Top level heading: Maybe a page title

A paragraph of text. Some information we would like to communicate to the user. This can be as long or short as we would like.

    Number one on the list
    Number two
    A third item

The HyperText part of HTML comes from the early days of the web and its original use case. Pages usually contained static documents that contained references to other documents. These references contained hypertext links used by the browser to navigate to the reference document so the user could read the reference document without having to manually search for it.

As web pages and web applications grow more complex, the W3 Consortium updates the HTML specification to ensure that a webpage can be shown reliably on any browser. The latest version of HTML is HTML5.

This section introduces how to use HTML elements to give structure and meaning to your web content.  -->

<!-- Now let's create a web form.
---------------------------------
input elements are a convenient way to get input from your user.
You can create a text input like this:
<input type="text">
Note that input elements are self-closing. -->

       <input type="text" /><br/><br/>


<!-- Placeholder text is what is displayed in your input element 
before your user has inputted anything.
You can create placeholder text like so:
<input type="text" placeholder="this is placeholder text">
Note: Remember that input elements are self-closing. -->

        <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL"/><br/><br/>


<!--You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server 
using nothing more than pure HTML. You can do this by specifying 
an action on your form element.
For example:
<form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data"></form> -->

        <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
            <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL">
        </form><br/><br/>

        

<!-- Let's add a submit button to your form. Clicking this button 
will send the data from your form to the URL you specified with your 
form's action attribute.

Here's an example submit button:
<button type="submit">this button submits the form</button>  -->
        <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
            <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL">
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form><br/><br/>



<!-- You can require specific form fields so that your user will not 
be able to submit your form until he or she has filled them out.
For example, if you wanted to make a text input field required, you 
can just add the attribute required within your input element, like this: 
<input type="text" required>                                          -->

        <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
            <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
            <button type="submit">Submit</button> <br/><br/>
        </form><br/><br/>



<!-- You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only 
give you one answer out of multiple options.
Radio buttons are a type of input.
Each of your radio buttons can be nested within its own label element. 
By wrapping an input element inside of a label element it will automatically 
associate the radio button input with the label element surrounding it.

All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio 
button group. By creating a radio group, selecting any single radio button will 
automatically deselect the other buttons within the same group ensuring only one 
answer is provided by the user.

Here's an example of a radio button:

<label> 
  <input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
</label>

It is considered best practice to set a for attribute on the label element, with 
a value that matches the value of the id attribute of the input element. 
This allows assistive technologies to create a linked relationship between 
the label and the child input element. For example:

<label for="indoor"> 
  <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
</label>

Add a pair of radio buttons to your form, each nested in its own label element. 
One should have the option of indoor and the other should have the option of 
outdoor. Both should share the name attribute of indoor-outdoor to create a 
radio group.                                                                  -->

        <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
            <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
            
            <label for="indoor">
              <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"/>Indoor
            </label>
        
            <label for="outdoor">
              <input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" />Outdoor
            </label>

            <button type="submit">Submit</button> <br/><br/>
        </form><br/><br/>



<!-- Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more 
than one answer.

Checkboxes are a type of input.

Each of your checkboxes can be nested within its own label element. 
By wrapping an input element inside of a label element it will 
automatically associate the checkbox input with the label element 
surrounding it.

All related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute.

It is considered best practice to explicitly define the relationship between 
a checkbox input and its corresponding label by setting the for attribute on 
the label element to match the id attribute of the associated input element.

Here's an example of a checkbox:

<label for="loving">
    <input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"> 
    Loving
</label>                                                                 -->
        <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
            <label for="indoor"><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>
            <label for="outdoor"><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label><br>
            <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
        
            <label for="loving" >
              <input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality" />One 
            </label>
        
            <label for="loving">
              <input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"/>Two 
            </label>
        
            <label for="loving">
              <input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"/>Three 
            </label>
        
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form><br/><br/>



<!-- When a form gets submitted, the data is sent to the server and 
includes entries for the options selected. Inputs of type 'radio' and 
'checkbox' report their values from the value attribute.

For example:

<label for="indoor"> 
  <input id="indoor" value="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">
  Indoor 
</label>

<label for="outdoor"> 
  <input id="outdoor" value="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">
  Outdoor 
</label>

Here, you have two 'radio' inputs. When the user submits the form with 
the 'indoor' option selected, the form data will include the line: 
 'indoor-outdoor=indoor'. This is from the 'name' and 'value' attributes 
of the "indoor" input.

If you omit the 'value' attribute, the submitted form data uses the default 
value, which is on. In this scenario, if the user clicked the "indoor" 
option and submitted the form, the resulting form data would be 
'indoor-outdoor=on', which is not useful. So the 'value' attribute needs 
to be set to something to identify the option.                        -->

        <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
            <label><input type="radio" value="indoor" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>
            <label><input type="radio" value="outdoor"name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label><br>
            <label><input type="checkbox" value="loving" name="personality"> Loving</label>
            <label><input type="checkbox" value="lazy" name="personality"> Lazy</label>
            <label><input type="checkbox" value="energetic" name="personality"> Energetic</label><br>
            <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form><br/><br/>


<!-- You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using 
the checked attribute.
To do this, just add the word "checked" to the inside of an input element. 
For example:

<input type="radio" name="test-name" checked>
 -->

        <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
            <label for="indoor">
            <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor" checked/> 
            Indoor
            </label>

            <label for="outdoor">
            <input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor"> 
            Outdoor
            </label><br>

            <label for="loving">
            <input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="loving" checked> 
            Loving
            </label>

            <label for="lazy">
            <input id="lazy" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="lazy">
            Lazy
            </label>

            <label for="energetic">
            <input id="energetic" type="checkbox" name="personality" value="energetic"> 
            Energetic
            </label><br>
            <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>

<!-- 

The div element, also known as a division element, is a general purpose 
container for other elements.

The div element is probably the most commonly used HTML element of all.

Just like any other non-self-closing element, you can open a div element 
with <div> and close it on another line with </div>. -->

        <div>
            <p>Things cats love:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>cat nip</li>

            <li>lasagna</li>

<!-- The challenges so far have covered specific HTML elements and their uses. 
However, there are a few elements that give overall structure to your page, 
and should be included in every HTML document.

At the top of your document, you need to tell the browser which version of HTML 
your page is using. HTML is an evolving language, and is updated regularly. 
Most major browsers support the latest specification, which is HTML5. 
However, older web pages may use previous versions of the language.

You tell the browser this information by adding the <!DOCTYPE ...> tag on 
the first line, where the ... part is the version of HTML. 
For HTML5, you use <!DOCTYPE html>.

The ! and uppercase DOCTYPE is important, especially for older browsers. 
The html is not case sensitive.

Next, the rest of your HTML code needs to be wrapped in html tags. 
The opening <html> goes directly below the <!DOCTYPE html> line, and the closing 
</html> goes at the end of the page.

Here's an example of the page structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 --Your HTML code goes here --
</html>


You can add another level of organization in your HTML document within the html tags with the head and body elements. Any markup with information about your page would go into the head tag. Then any markup with the content of the page (what displays for a user) would go into the body tag.

Metadata elements, such as link, meta, title, and style, typically go inside the head element.

Here's an example of a page's layout:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    -metadata elements-
</head>
<body>
  -page contents-
</body>
</html>

-->

    </main>





</body>
</html>
