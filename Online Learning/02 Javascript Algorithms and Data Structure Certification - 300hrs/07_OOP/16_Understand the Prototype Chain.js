Because a prototype is an object, a prototype can have its own prototype!

/* 
The hasOwnProperty method is defined in Object.prototype.

This method can be accessed by Bird.prototype, which can then 
be accessed by duck. 

This is an example of the prototype chain. In this prototype chain, 
 > Bird is the supertype for duck, 
 > duck is the subtype. 
 > Object is a supertype for both Bird and duck. 
 > Object is a supertype for all objects in JavaScript. 
 
 
 Therefore, any object can use the hasOwnProperty method.
